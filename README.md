# Vanilla NodeJS REST API 

Vanilla NodeJS REST API made for fun while practicing my knowledge and learning new stuff.

## Overview
---
In this project besides from core modules like `fs` and `http` I installed two more modules `uuid` for generating IDs while creating new post and `dotenv` so I can load enviromental variables.

## Routes

| Method |      Route       | 
|:------:|:---------------: | 
| GET    | /api/posts       |         
| GET    | /api/posts/`:id` | 
| POST   | /api/posts/      | 
| PUT    | /api/posts/`:id` | 
| DELETE | /api/posts/`:id` |
